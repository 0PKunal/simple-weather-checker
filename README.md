## 🚀 Quick Start

Clone and compile with any C99-compatible compiler:

```
git clone https://github.com/0PKunal/simple-weather-checker.git
cd simple-weather-checker
gcc -o weather_checker weather_checker.c
./weather_checker
```
Or on Windows (with MinGW):
```
gcc -o weather_checker.exe weather_checker.c
weather_checker.exe
```

## 💻 Example Session

```
What is the weather like? (1: Sunny, 2: Cloudy, 3: Rainy): 2
It's a bit gloomy today. Don't forget your umbrella!
```
(Messages may vary depending on your menu design.)

## 🔍 Code Analysis

- **Input**: Reads an integer (1, 2, or 3) representing weather.
- **Branching**: Uses if-else or switch statements.
- **Output**: Prints a message for each weather type.
- **Robustness**: Minimal input validation; entering other values may behave unpredictably.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Practice with user input via `scanf`.
- Gain experience with if-else or switch-case structures.
- Understand how to write simple console-based interactive programs.
- Recognize the importance of input validation and user guidance.

## 🛠️ Improvements & Roadmap

| Priority | Enhancement                                        | Why?             |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| High     | Input validation for out-of-range values            | Robustness       |
| Medium   | Use enums and better prompts                        | Readability      |
| Medium   | Accept both numeric and text input (`sunny`, etc.)  | Usability        |
| Low      | Localize output messages                            | Internationalize|

**Sample code improvement:**
- Use `fgets` instead of `scanf` for safer input.
- Provide clear error messages for invalid choices.
